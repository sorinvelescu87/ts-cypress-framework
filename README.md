# ts-cypress-framework 

## Intro 
This is a framework built by me to test pages from http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/

## Setup 
To see how the framework works you need to first clone this repo. 

In the ts-cypress-framework folder just run: 
```
npm install 
```
This will Install all dependencies, including cypress and typescript. This is going to take about 5 minutes. 

To run and see the reports you need to run two commands:
```
  npm rum tests:cli - wait for all tests to run;
  npm run create:html:report - this will generate a HTML report in the test_reports folder.
```
If you have troubles running the first command on Windows, please make sure to run it in a Git Bash terminal. 

The repo already has an example for this report.
